# The Striking Tree (Extreme)

### Phase 1

* At the start, the main tank will pick up 3 orbs, once the main tank has gained Surge Protection the dps should pick up the remainder of the orbs, no more than 2 per player.


* At about 20 seconds left on the buff, the off tank should gather 3 orbs, and provoke the boss off the MT, the dps should again clean up the orbs.


* Throughout the fight, players will be marked with chaos, these players should move to (A) before they get stunned. After, Ramuh will use thunderstorm marking the ground and random players with an AoE. This AoE needs to hit the players affected with chaos, or else they'll be charmed and killed. Note: you should try to only hit players with only one of these AoEs to prevent unessesary damage.


* **These first mechanics will repeat throughout the entire fight.**

### Phase 2
* Eventually adds will spawn and should be killed starting from behind Ramuh (A) moving clockwise until cleared. If you fail to clear them out in the alotted time, you will wipe.

### Phase 3
* Entering the final phase, we introduce Rolling Thunder. This creates a tether between two people, which will cause damage if either do any action, they take increasing damage the more actions are taken; this includes moving.
  * If thethered, stop DPS COMPLETELY, only heal using large heals when absolutely needed.


* Tether clearing priority is as follows: OT>DPS>Healer.
  * If two dps are tethered, just decide on the fly who will do it, you can use tricks like whoever is higher alphabetically, or have a ranged/melee dps do it, etc.


* Adds will spawn again, but they can't be targeted, so just avoid the lightning lazers and finish off Ramuh!
