## Character Growth

### Experience
When starting from floor 1, players start at level 1 regardless of their current level. By defeating monsters that appear in the dungeon, players will be able to gain EXP and level their characters up to 60. The levels gained in progression of the dungeon, however, will not be the same as what players will receive upon clearing.

For example, when entering floor one at level 35, you will start at level 1 inside palace of the dead. However, upon successfully completing a set of floors, you will gain a certain amount of experience for whatever class you cleared PotD with, which will be applied when you exit the duty.

### Gear

inside PotD, you will use an aetherpool arm and aetherpool armor instead of your equipped gear Players must enhance this gear by opening Silver Coffers.

Note that your gear and stats have no affect inside palace of the dead.

## Pomanders
Players can obtain pomanders from Golden Coffers. Each has a unique affects, and up to three of each pomander can be held at any time in a shared inventory to be used by all party members.
